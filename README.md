# Iris KNN Classifier

This project uses the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to classify flowers in the famous Iris dataset.

## 📌 Dataset Info
- 150 samples
- 4 features: Sepal/Petal length & width
- 3 classes: Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica

## ⚙️ Model Used
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## 📈 Accuracy for Different K Values

| K | Accuracy |
|---|----------|
| 1 | 100%     |
| 3 | 100%     |
| 5 | 100%     |
| 7 | 97%      |

## ✅ Conclusion
KNN performs exceptionally well on the Iris dataset. Future work can involve testing with other ML models and using cross-validation for stability.
